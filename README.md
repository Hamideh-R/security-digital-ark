Security Highlights
Passwords: All passwords (individual and group) are hashed using password_hash() (bcrypt).

Verification: Passwords are verified via password_verify() to prevent brute-force attacks.

File Validation:

Maximum size: 10 MB

Allowed types: .jpeg, .png, .pdf, .zip, .txt

Overwrite Protection: Rejects file uploads with existing filenames.
************************************************

Upload Process: 

Go to index.php

Choose a file to upload.

(Optional) Set:

A password for individual access.

A group name for group-based access (must exist in group-passwords.json)

Click Upload.

View or download uploaded files from list.php.
************************************************

Download Process: 

Go to list.php

Find the file you want to download.

If it's protected:

Enter the required password.

Click Download.

The system checks:

If the file exists

If the metadata matches

If the password (individual or group) is valid

ðŸ§± Group Access (Advanced)
Groups are defined in data/group-passwords.json. Example:

{
  "admins": "$2y$10$hash...",
  "students": "$2y$10$hash...",
  "research": "$2y$10$hash..."
}
To generate a new group password:

echo password_hash("yourGroupPassword", PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
Add the result to group-passwords.json.
************************************************

ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX
Clean design with responsive layout

Alerts for:

Success messages

Errors (invalid format, file too big, duplicate, etc.)

Buttons styled with Bootstrap (btn-primary, btn-secondary, btn-danger)

Password input styling is consistent across forms
